            <p>My style guide mainly consists of images from manga and other websites similar to what I am trying to
                achieve with my website. The aim is to achieve a japanese manga aesthetic, with white and black beeing
                the dominating colours. I have found inspiration from popular manga websites such as Viz media in terms
                of creating a unique and
                visually appealing layout that my users can navigate with ease. I have been looking into different
                typography styles for my website, but I have decided to chose Arial as my main font, mainly
                because it is one of the most common and readable fonts present in manga websites. And lastly my colour
                pallettes, which i chose consist of dark blues and browns, but i will most likely go for dark blues such
                as navy or border closer to black and greys as I continue to progress with the development of my site.
            </p>
            <p>Final choice: I have opted to continue with a black to grey colour scheme for my website. I believe this
                suites the webseite best seeing as my main selling point is manga which are typically drawn in black and
                white.</p>
